1. Conducted AB Test for Website Improvement: Designed and implemented an AB test to evaluate the impact of a new background color palette on user engagement for a machine learning content website.
2. Metric Evaluation : Focused on the `average session duration` metric, which initially measured 30.87 minutes, to determine the effectiveness of the visual change.
3. Data Handling and Analysis : Collected and analyzed user session data over a 20-day period, randomly splitting users into control and variation groups.
4. Hypothesis Testing : Performed statistical analysis to compare the average session durations between the two groups, aiding in decision-making on whether to adopt the new design.
